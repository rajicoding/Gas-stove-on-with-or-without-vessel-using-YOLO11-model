# Gas-stove-on-with-or-without-vessel-using-YOLO11-model
Object detection using YOLO model for a custom Dataset
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
People sometimes forget to switch off the gas stove and leave it unattended. This may lead to a fire accident, and a life-threatening one.
 As an AI Engineer,  propose a solution to predict whether the gas stove is on with or without a vessel

LABELSTUDIO – Open source tool used for image labelling and to download the respective annotation files to run the model
ULTRALYTICS – to run YOLO V11 model
YOLO V11 – to train the custom dataset
Python 3.12
Pytorch – CUDA 12.6 (for enabling GPU option)
Anaconda prompt– To train, validate and deploy the model using python code
